# Student-and-Subject-Operation

I have completed all parts of the project except for the security part because I am not familiar with Spring Security. I work on backend development using Spring Boot, and I use Postman for API calls.

To run the project, start the class annotated with **@SpringBootApplication**.
To test the project, you need to download Eclipse IDE and Postman.
